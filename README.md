**Pokémon Through the Generations**
This project is an exploration of Pokémon data from generations 1 through 6. Using data analysis techniques and Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project examines various attributes of Pokémon across these generations.

I've always loved Pokémon, and this project was a fun way to combine that passion with data analysis concepts I've learned.

This project analyzes Pokémon data to answer questions such as:

What percentage of Pokémon belong to each generation?
What are the most common Pokémon types across generations?
How do different attributes (e.g., base stats) vary among Pokémon types?
The project includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summaries.

**Features**
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicate or unnecessary forms (e.g., Mega Evolutions, alternate forms) to focus on base Pokémon.
Statistical Analysis: Counts and percentages for attributes such as types and generations.
Data Visualization: Pie charts, histograms, and more to represent Pokémon distributions and trends.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For visualizations like pie charts.
Seaborn: For creating aesthetically pleasing plots.

**Data Source**
The Pokémon dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link-here
cd pokemon-through-generations
Install required libraries:
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run the project:
Open the project file and execute it in your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE).

**Results**
Some key insights from the analysis:

Generation Distribution: A pie chart shows the percentage of Pokémon from each generation.
Type Distribution: Counted Pokémon by type (e.g., Water, Fire, Dragon).
Visualizations:
Distribution of Pokémon by generation.
Most common Pokémon types across generations.
